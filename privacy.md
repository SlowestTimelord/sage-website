# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: December 22, 2024

## Introduction

Welcome to our Privacy Policy. Your privacy is critically important to us, and we are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding data collection and usage.

## No Data Collection

Our app does not collect, store, process, or transmit any personal information about our users. We have specifically designed our app to operate without the need for:

- Personal information
- Usage data
- Device information
- Location data
- Analytics
- Cookies or tracking mechanisms
- User accounts or profiles

## How the App Works

Our app functions as a wallet for the Chia blockchain. While the app requires internet connectivity to interact with the blockchain network, we maintain a strict privacy-first approach:

- No user accounts or profiles are created or maintained
- Your private keys are stored locally on your device and are never transmitted
- The app only communicates with the Chia blockchain network for necessary operations
- We only request system permissions strictly necessary for wallet functionality
- All sensitive operations are performed locally on your device

## Blockchain Network and Protocol Interactions

Our app interacts with the Chia blockchain network and integrates with the following protocols/services in a completely permissionless manner:

- Direct interactions with the Chia blockchain network
- Integration with Dexie protocol for decentralized exchange functionality
- Integration with MintGarden for NFT-related features

All these interactions are:

- Completely permissionless (no accounts required)
- Direct between your wallet and the respective protocols
- Performed without collecting or storing any personal information
- Secured by your local private keys which never leave your device
- Visible on the public blockchain, as is standard for blockchain technology

We do not operate any central servers, and no personal information is transmitted during these interactions. The app does not integrate with any analytics providers or advertising networks.

## Children's Privacy

Our app is safe for use by children as it does not collect any personal information from users of any age.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

If we decide to change our privacy practices, we will update this Privacy Policy. The "Last Updated" date at the beginning of this Privacy Policy indicates when it was last revised.

## Your Choices

You can use our app with confidence knowing that no personal information is being collected, stored, or shared. No opt-outs or privacy settings are necessary as no data collection occurs.

## Security

While we maintain high security standards in our app development and maintenance, no specific data security measures are required for user data protection as we do not collect or store any user information.
